Our goal with each of these areas is as follows:

Change the css method call to an addClass and removeClass call instead to keep your CSS out of your JavaScript
Combine the click events into one since they share functionality, avoiding repeated code
Remove the conditionals in the accordion click and use toggleClass instead
Pull your credit card number code out into a function that can be called to obtain the sum of the odd and even digits. Then remove the show and hide conditionals and change the show/hide method calls to toggle calls instead.
Remove the switch statement and replace it with a logic-less means of setting the text. Eliminate all but one of the text method calls in your code. As a hint, think about how this could be rewritten to use object properties.
